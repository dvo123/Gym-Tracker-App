Gym Tracker App

## Getting Started

Overview: 

    Gym Tracker is a fitness application designed to help users track their gym 
sessions, monitor workout frequency and maintain a consistent exercise routine
by utilizing the HeatMap plugin.

Installation:

    1. Download my code from Git Hub.
    2. Make a new project and add my android folder + lib folder + pubspec.yaml into your project.
    3. Run "flutter pub get" to get the dependencies.
    4. Run the app.

How to use the app:

    1. Create a workout category on the Home Page screen.
    2. Tap on that workout category and then create an exercise based on that category.
    3. Tap the checkbox when you finish an exercise and it will update on the calendar.
    4. The number of exercises you completed will determine the color on the calendar:
        1-3 exercises show a faint light green, indicating a light workout session.
        4-7 exercises show a strong green, indicating a healthy amount of exercise.
        8-9 exercises show an orange color, warning maybe too many exercises for a session.
        10+ exercises show a strong red color, indicating an unhealthy amount of exercises per session.
